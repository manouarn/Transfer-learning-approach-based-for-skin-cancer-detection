# Transfer-learning-approach-based-for-skin-cancer-detection
Nowadays skin cancer is increasing due to several factors. Cancer detection has become an important research
field. Several research proposed models, algorithm to detect cancer from image. Image classification is an
effective tool to solve cancer classification problems.
This paper proposed a transfer learning approach based for cancer detection. Authors used different transfer
learning models Resnet50, Vgg16, Vgg19 InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 and CNN model. After trained these
models. The result obtained by InceptionV3 0.98 Resnet50 0.97 Vgg19 0.92 and Vgg16 0.89 are the best
result compared to CNN model 0.78. This indicates the importance of transfer learning.
